# PWM-DRAWER
Drawing a PWM Signal using Graphical LCD and ATmega32A
PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible 
for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated 
PWM signal.
The output voltage of the PWM signal will be the percentage of the duty cycle. For example, for a 100% duty cycle, if the operating voltage is 5 V then the output voltage will also be 5 V. If the duty cycle is 50%, then the output voltage will be 2.5 V.â€‹
